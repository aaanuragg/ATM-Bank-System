# ATM / Bank Management System in C++

A menu-driven ATM / Bank Management System built in C++ to practice core programming concepts and logical thinking.

## Features
- Secure PIN authentication with a maximum of 3 attempts
- Balance inquiry
- Deposit money with input validation
- Withdraw money with insufficient balance checks
- Menu-driven interface using a do-while loop
- Safe exit option

## Concepts Used
- C++ fundamentals
- Conditional statements (if-else)
- Looping constructs (while, do-while)
- User input validation
- Basic security logic

## Purpose
This project was created during a semester break to revise and strengthen core C++ concepts through hands-on practice.

## Future Improvements
- Modular design using functions
- File handling for data persistence
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
